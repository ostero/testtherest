System:
You are given a maze and a task.
The maze is a grid made of characters. 
Maze Legend:
    n = Wall or obstacle (cannot be passed)
    y = Free path
    r = Robotâ€™s starting position
    d = Destination

The task is to generate robot instructions to guide the robot 'r' to the destination 'd'.
Robot Instructions:

You must write a JSON object with a field named "steps".
    "steps" should be a string containing a comma-separated list of directions.
    Valid directions are: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
    The robot moves one square in the specified direction per step.
    The robot cannot move into walls (n) or go outside the maze.
    The robot will only read the "steps" field. Any other fields are ignored but allowed.

Answer with the json object only. No additoinal words at all. 

Example maze:
nnnnnnnn
nyyyynyn
nynnnnnn
nyydynnn
nnnnyyrn

For the presented maze example the correct answer is:

 "steps": "LEFT", "LEFT", "UP", "LEFT"
}
